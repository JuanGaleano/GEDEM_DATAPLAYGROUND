Shiny r-code for GEDEM's Data-playground. Available [***HERE***](https://gedemced.shinyapps.io/DP_CATALONIA/)

GEDEM's data-playground allows users to explore, visualize and download population data for each municipality 
                                  in Spain (over 8,000 municipalities) since 2000. The database also includes computations of various indices 
                                  of segregation and diversity using the smallest geographical units available (Census Tracts).
Users can download and reuse data (as csv or txt files) and plots (as png files). 

The project is part of my PhD in Demography at the [Centre d'Estudis Demogràfics (CED)](http://ceu.uab.es) and the Autonomous University of Barcelona.
